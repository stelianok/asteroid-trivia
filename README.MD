## 👨🏻‍💻 About the project

-  [Hackathon of Codedamn](https://codedamn.com/hackfest)
<p> We used Nasa’s API Asteroids – NeoWs (Near-Earth Object Web Service) to get reliable data about asteroids including their id, name, diameter, speed, last approach, and if it is hazardous.</p>

<p>
The main technologies that we have used to create our web app were React.js, with some helpful libraries such as styled-components, to better organize our CSS code and application as a whole,  font-awesome to get pretty icons. </p>

<p>
We have also used Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to better organize our API calls and avoid code duplication. allowing us to communicate with APIs easily in our React apps 
</p>

<p>
Asteroid Trivia has a clean design and a straightforward proposition: show information about asteroids but in a remarkably interesting way. But just showing large numbers does not make us aware of the magnitude of those space objects. For this reason, we decided to compare their data with animals' data.  For example, we show approximately how many aligned blue whales would be necessary to achieve the average asteroid’s diameter.

$ git clone https://github.com/stelianok/asteroid-trivia.git && cd asteroid-trivia
```



**Follow the steps below**

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Be sure the file 'src/services/api.ts' have the IP to your API

# Start the client
$ yarn dev
```
